## React for Drupal

### Description

Add ReactJS to Drupal node pages in a progressively decoupled manner
utilizing webpack.

### How to use

1. In the CLI, cd to /path/to/module/app and run npm install.
2. Run `npm run build` to compile components. This will create an aggregated main.js and main.css
   files which will be loaded in through Drupal. You will need to run this command each time
   you make changes to your React code.
